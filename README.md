This application ties the SQL database bamazon with node.  Using inquirer, we prompt the user to purchase an item and the quantity they would like to purchase.

If we have enough stock, we will tell the user they were successful and play back what they purchased and the amount.  We will also infom them of the total amount.
If we do not have enough stock, we will inform the user that we could not fulfill the order.
